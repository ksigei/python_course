# Advanced Python Topics

In this document, we will explore various advanced topics in Python.

## 1. Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

### Design Patterns

Python supports various design patterns that can enhance code structure and maintainability.

#### Singleton Pattern
```python
class Singleton:
    _instance = None
    
    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance
```

### Metaclasses

Metaclasses allow you to customize class creation.

```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, attrs):
        # Modify attributes or class before creation
        attrs['version'] = 1.0
        return super(MyMeta, cls).__new__(cls, name, bases, attrs)
```

## 2. Functional Programming in Python

### Lambda Functions

Lambda functions are anonymous functions for short tasks.

```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
result = add(3, 5)
```

### Closures and Decorators

Closures capture and remember the enclosing scope.

```python
def outer_func(message):
    def inner_func():
        print(message)
    return inner_func

my_closure = outer_func("Hello, Closure!")
my_closure()
```

## 3. Concurrency and Multithreading

### Threading and the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

Python's GIL can limit true multithreading.

```python
import threading

def worker():
    print("Thread working")

thread1 = threading.Thread(target=worker)
thread2 = threading.Thread(target=worker)

thread1.start()
thread2.start()
```

### Asynchronous Programming with asyncio

Asyncio allows asynchronous programming.

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Hello, Async!")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 4. Advanced Data Structures

### Custom Data Structures

Python allows creating custom data structures.

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.children = []
```

### Using Sets, Queues, and Stacks

Sets, queues, and stacks are powerful data structures.

```python
my_set = {1, 2, 3}
my_queue = queue.Queue()
my_stack = []

my_queue.put(1)
my_stack.append(1)
```

## 5. Decorators and Metaprogramming

### Creating and Using Decorators

Decorators modify functions or methods.

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
```

## 6. Advanced I/O and File Handling

### Binary File I/O

Binary I/O allows reading and writing binary data.

```python
with open("binary.dat", "wb") as file:
    file.write(b"\x01\x02\x03")

with open("binary.dat", "rb") as file:
    data = file.read()
```

### Network Programming with Sockets

Python provides socket support for network programming.

```python
import socket

server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server_socket.bind(("localhost", 12345))
server_socket.listen(5)
```

## 7. Advanced Exception Handling

### Creating Custom Exceptions

Custom exceptions can improve code clarity.

```python
class MyCustomError(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):
        super().__init__(message)
```

### Using Context Managers

Context managers simplify resource management.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

## 8. Performance Optimization

### Profiling and Optimizing Python Code

Profiling helps identify bottlenecks for optimization.

```python
import cProfile

def my_function():
    # Function to profile
    pass

cProfile.run("my_function()")
```

### Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation with Numba

Numba accelerates Python functions.

```python
import numba

@numba.jit
def fast_function(x):
    # Fast, compiled code
    return x * 2
```

## 9. Pythonic Idioms and Best Practices

### Writing Clean and Pythonic Code

Follow PEP 8 style guide and Pythonic idioms.

```python
# Pythonic list comprehension
squared = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

## 10. Debugging and Testing

### Advanced Debugging Techniques

Advanced debugging tools like pdb.

```python
import pdb

def my_function():
    x = 1
    y = 0
    pdb.set_trace()
    result = x / y
```

### Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Writing unit tests for code reliability.

```python
import unittest

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

class TestAddition(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)
```
